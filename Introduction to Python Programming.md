# INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS
    * A computer is an electronics device that can receive, process, store, and output data
    * It consists of hardware (physical components) and software (programs that run on the
hardware)
    * The basic components of a computer are:
        - Central Processing Unit (CPU):
        - Memory Unit: 
        - Input Devices:
        - Output Devices:
    * Memory futher devided into 2 types : 
        1. Read-only memory (ROM): 
        2. Random-access memory (RAM):
